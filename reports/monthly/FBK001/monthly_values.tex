\newcommand{\tips}{Consider reducing the set temperature on your heater. A one degree reduction in your set temperature results in about 2\% savings on your fuel bill. The U.S. Department of Energy recommends setting your temperature to 68 degrees when you are at home and awake, and recommends turning down the temperature (by as much as 10 degrees) during the nighttime hours when you are asleep or when you are away from your home.
